When you use bitcoins to deposit money to a casino you don’t need to give away any credit card details. No higher authority is regulating bitcoins so you stay in control of your money at all time. Transactions are faster and cheaper than regular bank transfers. Another advantage is that you don’t need to wait until the bank is open. You can use bitcoins at any time of the day, any day of the year. Let’s explain how easy it is to get started to play at our bitcoin casino.



1.Get a bitcoin wallet
Before we can buy bitcoins we need some place to store them, like an online wallet. There are many bitcoin wallets with different pros and cons. If you want to add the highest level of security to your bitcoins you could store your bitcoin offline. This is recommended if you have a lot of bitcoins and want to keep them for a long time. If you, however, want to use them on a regular basis it’s preferable to use an online wallet. One popular wallet is Bread Wallet. It’s a mobile based app that give you access to your coins at any time. You can download it from App Store or Goolge play. The interface is user-friendly and you can open the account anonymously. If you want to know more about various bitcoin wallet options we recommend to take a look here.

2. Buy bitcoins
The fastest way to acquire bitcoins is to buy them via a crypto exchange. This can be done in a few minutes. We highly recommend you to choose a regulated exchange to keep high security of your money. Coinbase.com has a good reputation in the business. They are easy to use and accept both credit cards and bank transfers. To register with a regulated exchange requires you to identify yourself. This will add more security to your account. Don’t worry, if you want to stay anonymous you’ll still be that by using an anonymous bitcoin wallet for your purchases.
There a number of reputable regulated bitcoin exchanges.

3. Transfer bitcoins to your wallet
Most bitcoin exchanges also offer a bitcoin wallet. We recommend to keep the bitcoin exchange and bitcoin wallet separately though. This is for your protection and anonymity. Before you can start using your purchased bitcoin you need to send them to your bitcoin wallet. This is done in 3 simple steps.

Copy and paste in the bitcoin address to your wallet.
Choose the amount to bitcoin you want to send
