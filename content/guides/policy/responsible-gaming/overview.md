*** Promoting entertainment – discouraging irresponsible gaming ***

## What is the Responsible Gaming initiative?

El Bet Casino takes measures to implement procedures which help to prevent the abuse of gambling. Gaming is an excellent form of online entertainment enjoyed by millions of people every day. The vast majority of gamblers enjoy their experience and do not encounter any issues. It is the case however that some people often become addicted to online gaming that involves gambling. We recognise this and take every step possible to strongly discourage this issue.

## What symptoms should you look out for?

Gambling can be addictive in the same way that alcohol or drugs can be. Losing a little more than you had hoped at the casino is not going to drastically damage your life however losing significant sums of money on a regular basis is a sign that you or someone you know is suffering from compulsive gambling and possibly an addiction. This type of gambling addiction can result in massive disruption in several areas of live such as mental health, physical health, social issues and family relationship. Problem gambling is most common among young men and can begin later in women.

It’s often said that prevention is the best medicine in any medical issue however it can be very difficult to prevent an addictive behaviour from developing. If you have close relatives who have had problem with gambling in the past then you should be especially cautious.
